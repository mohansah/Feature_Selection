# Feature_Selection

It is a technique which select the most relevant features from the original dataset.

Feature selection is one of the first and important steps while performing any machine learning task. A feature in case of a dataset simply means a column. When we get any dataset, not necessarily every column (feature) is going to have an impact on the output variable. If we add these irrelevant features in the model, it will just make the model worst. This gives rise to the need of doing feature selection.
